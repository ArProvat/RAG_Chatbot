  "text": "# World Health Organization Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report – 51\n\nData as reported by national authorities by 10 AM CET 11 March 2020\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS\n\n*   WHO Director-General in his regular media briefing today stated that WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction. WHO therefore have made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic. For detailed information, please see [here](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020).\n\n*   Four new countries/territories/areas (Bolivia [Plurinational State of], Jamaica, Burkina Faso and Democratic Republic of the Congo) have reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.\n\n*   The COVID-19 virus infects people of all ages. However, evidence to date suggests that two groups of people are at a higher risk of getting severe COVID-19 disease. These are older people; and those with underlying medical conditions. WHO emphasizes that all must protect themselves from COVID-19 in order to protect others. For more information, please see 'subject in focus'.\n\n*   On 10 March, the IFRC, UNICEF and WHO issued a new guidance to help protect children and schools from transmission of the COVID-19 virus. The guidance provides critical considerations and practical checklists to keep schools safe. More information can be found [here](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/key-messages-and-actions-for-covid-19-prevention-and-control-in-schools-march-2020.pdf?sfvrsn=baf81d52_4).\n\n## SITUATION IN NUMBERS\ntotal and new cases in last 24 hours\n\n**Globally**\n118 319 confirmed (4620 new)\n4292 deaths (280 new)\n\n**China**\n80 955 confirmed (31 new)\n3162 deaths (22 new)\n\n**Outside of China**\n37 364 confirmed (4589 new)\n1130 deaths (258 new)\n113 countries/territories/\nareas (4 new)\n\n## WHO RISK ASSESSMENT\n\nChina: Very High\nRegional Level: Very High\nGlobal Level: Very High\n\nErratum: 'Total cases' and 'new cases' for Bulgaria and Paraguay have been corrected.\n\n## SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Risk Communication guidance - COVID-19, older adults and people with underlying medical conditions\n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 infects people of all ages. However, evidence to date suggests that two groups of people are at a higher risk of getting severe COVID-19 disease. These are older people (that is people over 60 years old); and those with underlying medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer). The risk of severe disease gradually increases with age starting from around 40 years. It's important that adults in this age range protect themselves and in turn protect others that may be more vulnerable.\n\nWHO has issued advice for these two groups and for community support to ensure that they are protected from COVID-19 without being isolated, stigmatized, left in a position of increased vulnerability or unable to access basic provisions and social care. This advice covers the subject of receiving visitors, planning for supplies of medication and food, going out safely in public and staying connected with others through phone calls or other means. It is essential that these groups are supported by their communities during the COVID-19 outbreak. WHO emphasizes that all people must protect themselves from COVID-19, which will also protect other.\n\n### Key advice for older adults and people with pre-existing conditions:\n\n*   When you have visitors to your home, exchange “1 metre greetings\", like a wave, nod, or bow.\n*   Ask visitors and those you live with to wash their hands.\n*   Regularly clean and disinfect surfaces in your home, especially areas that people touch a lot.\n*   If someone you live with isn't feeling well (especially with possible COVID-19 symptoms), limit your shared spaces.\n*   If you become ill with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your healthcare provider by telephone before visiting your healthcare facility.\n*   Make a plan in preparation for an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community.\n*   When you go out in public, follow the same preventative guidelines as you would at home.\n*   Stay up to date using information from reliable sources.\n\n## SURVEILLANCE\n\n## PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE\n\n*   To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to [this webpage](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance).\n*   WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n*   WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The guidance can be found on the [IATA webpage](https://www.iata.org/contentassets/d69437b98d69427b87c7170bc905c317/covid-19-cabin-crew-and-airport-workers.pdf).\n*   WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.\n*   WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated regularly.\n*   WHO has prepared a [disease commodity package](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/disease-commodity-package-for-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)) that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.\n*   WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of [transmission from animals to humans](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-technical-guidance-for-republic-of-korea).\n*   WHO has published an [updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV](https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detail/updated-who-advice-for-international-traffic-in-relation-to-the-outbreak-of-the-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov).\n*   WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.\n*   OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. [COVID-19 courses can be found here](https://openwho.org/courses?q=COVID-19). Specifically, WHO has developed online courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in Arabic, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian); Critical Care of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English and French); Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French, and Russian); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in English and Russian); and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness and response.\n*   WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available [here](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-technical-guidance-for-republic-of-korea). One such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \"[First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/a-first-few-x-(ffx)-cases-and-contact-investigation-protocol-for-2019-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-infection)\"). The protocol is designed to gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.\n\n## RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC\n\nIf you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses)). Seek guidance from WHO, your healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19 and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see [Protection measures for everyone](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public)).\n\nIf you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See [Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/for-the-elderly)).\n\n## CASE DEFINITIONS\n\nWHO periodically updates the [Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) document](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/global-surveillance-for-human-infection-with-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)) which includes case definitions.\n\nFor easy reference, case definitions are included below.\n\n### Suspect case\n\nA. A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g., cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See [situation report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200311-sitrep-51-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=1e530b5e_8)) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.\n\n**OR**\n\nB. A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms;\n\n**OR**\n\nC. A patient with severe acute respiratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalization AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation.\n\n### Probable case\n\nA suspect case for whom testing for COVID-19 is inconclusive.\n*   Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory\n\n### Confirmed case\n\nA person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.\n*   Information regarding laboratory guidance can be found [here](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/laboratory-testing-for-2019-novel-coronavirus-in-suspected-human-cases).\n",
